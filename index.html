        When we met
        You blew my mind
        I couldn't beleive, maybe I'm still dreaming right now

        You spoke Science
        Bout moons and stars
        You're so smart, maybe I'm still dreaming right now

        We have crazy arguments going all turmeric on each other
        But sweetie, that's the spice we need in the recipe of us

        You have your rough edges, hard and dry like sandwiches do
        Somehow I like the crusts better, cause I think about the real you

        Crossword is your safe haven, and reading books your fantasy
        Gosh I wonder why didn't I meet a, girl like you before

        Taylor Swift is a little champ, and Neil tyson a wise old man
        With Science and Art they really did, keep us together

        Rare like a blue moon only, we know isn't really blue
        What we have is so special, no one knows except me and you

        ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ

        You try different accents while, I go bonkers figuring them out
        I like the way you sound, regardless of what you speak

        You kept me motivated me with, "Whatever it takes"
        And you taught me how to love by, "Thinking out loud"

        I loved that night we drew up shapes, squares and some cubes
        You totally differentiated, and integrated my love for you

        If you weren't Indian, you'd probably be Japanese
        Living at Okinawa in, a close-knitted community

        I'm all confused how we will end up, A friendship or more than that
        At least one thing I can be sure of that, It will be good with me and you
        <div style="padding-left: 50px;">And <strong>You...</strong></div>
        ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ
